# LBYARCH-Sad-Number-Checker
Checks if a number is a "Sad" Number (if the iteration of sum-of-square-digits will reach 1)

## Current Version Limitations:
- Sad Number Input does not yet have invalidity checker, will implement soon.
- Program Restart Inputs only accept single characters, and trying to input a string will result in the program reading each of the characters present within the string individually.
- Program Restart Inputs will also accept Y's or N's that are part of invalid string inputs.
